A Neovim plugin that helps you open REPL such as lua, ipython, sbcl etc. in a
split window according to the current buffer |filetype|.

=============================================================================
                                                             *aedile-default*

You can change all the aedile defaults by using |aedile-setup|

aedile.nvim has mapped default REPL to some filetypes:
>
	local filetype_table = {
	-- filetype = repl
	   lua      = 'lua',
	   lisp     = 'sbcl',
	   python   = 'python',
	}
<

You can change it later via |aedile-repl| by adding REPL support to other
filetypes or modify the existing settings. Be aware that those REPL must be
installed first into your system before you want this plugin to be effective.

aedilen.nvim also offer some key mappings to have control over the terminal
buffer after the REPL has been opened. By default, you could scroll up and
down with <M-u> and <M-d>. You are able to customise it accordingly as
|aedile-mappings| specified.

Furthermore, aedile.nvim by default split the window horizontally (see
|split|). If you don't like this default setting, you can modify the split
method by calling |aedile-split_method|.

                                                              *aedile-command*

toggle_repl()                                             *aedile-toggle_repl*
	Open REPL in a split window according to the current buffer
	filetype (for the first usage), and then toggle it on/off
	according to the window status (hidden/present).

	To use this command more effectively, you should map it by
	using |map-commands|. The recommended mapping is as follows:
>
	nnoremap <leader>rr :lua require("aedile").toggle_repl()<cr>
<
	Or in lua:
>
	vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
	'n',
	'<leader>rr',
	'<cmd>lua require("aedile").toggle_repl()<cr>')
<

terminate_repl()                                       *aedile-terminate_repl*
	Terminate the currently opened REPL and delete the buffer that REPL
	have resided.

	To use this command more effectively, you should map it by
	using |map-commands|. The recommended mapping is as follows:
>
	nnoremap <leader>rt :lua require("aedile").terminate_repl()<cr>
<
	Or in lua:
>
	vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
	'n',
	'<leader>rt',
	'<cmd>lua require("aedile").terminate_repl()<cr>')
<

	Setup aedile.nvim configurations.

Usage:

repl                                                             *aedile-repl*
	Modify the existing table for REPL by adding or overwriting.

split_method                                             *aedile-split_method*
	Modify the split method. Currently, only support `vertical`.
